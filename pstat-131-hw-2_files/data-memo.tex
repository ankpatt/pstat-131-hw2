\maketitle

\textbf{An overview of your dataset:} my spotify data

\textbf{What does it include?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Playlists
\item
  Search queries
\item
  Streaming history for the past year
\item
  A list of items saved in your library
\item
  The number of followers you have and the number of accounts you follow
\item
  Payment and subscription data
\item
  User data
\item
  Inferences
\item
  Voice input
\item
  Podcast interactivity
\item
  Family Plan data
\item
  Spotify for Artists data
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Where and how will you be obtaining it? Include the link and
source.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Obtained directly through Spotify by requesting for data in my
  ``privacy settings''. I requested it a few days ago, and it may take
  up to 30 days to send my data (haven't received it yet) but if there
  isn't enough information to conduct thorough studies, I will use
  ​​\url{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/} for
  another similar type of project based off other users data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{About how many observations? How many predictors?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Have not received the data yet.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What types of variables will you be working with?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Possibly song titles, genres, minutes listened to, etc.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What variable(s) are you interested in predicting? What
question(s) are you interested in answering?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I am interested in predicting how long I listen to a song depending on
  the genre. I skip songs a lot so I am curious to see how long certain
  songs maintain my interest and which genre they are. Maybe dive into
  sub-genre and artist.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Name your response/outcome variable(s) and briefly describe
it/them.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Response: most listened to genre in minutes.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Will these questions be best answered with a classification or
regression approach?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Maybe through a classification approach because if it is not my most
  listened to genre, I would not listen to it.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Which predictors do you think will be especially useful?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variety of genres I listen to and how related they are in terms of
  sound. I am not sure about my predictors though I have not received my
  dataset.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Is the goal of your model descriptive, predictive, inferential,
or a combination? Explain.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I think a mix of descriptive and inferential because we can look at
  the data and infer what I will probably listen to.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Your proposed project timeline: When do you plan on having your
data set loaded, beginning your exploratory data analysis, etc? Provide
a general timeline for the rest of the quarter.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Hopefully by the end of this week, simultaneously doing hw3. I hope yo
  organize my data and figure out the response and predictors, the goals
  of my project and divide into categories of what I want to do with my
  data. Hopefully I have enough information to work with, orelse I will
  change my topic. By working on it this week I will be able to
  determine how useful my Spotify data will be for this project. If my
  data does not come in time by the end of this week I will use data
  from other users through the API website provided, and consult
  professor during office hours on Friday.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Any questions or concerns Are there any problems or difficult
aspects of the project you anticipate?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I am just having a hard time choosing a topic I can maintain
  consistency on. I am scared I will lose interest in my topic if I
  don't choose one as interesting. Hopefully I am able to work on it
  this week and figure it out!
\end{itemize}
